## Dataset
The data used for this project is a vehicle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) from Kaggle. It is a dataset consisting of 8,000+ vehicles from India's car marketplace CarDekho. Prices were converted to Canadian dollars based on the conversion rate.

It does not include images for each vehicle. Thus, a Python script was used to fetch an image for each car using [DDGS](https://pypi.org/project/ddgs/) (Python search library) and included in the CSV file.

Limitations:
- Duplicate data within dataset
- Data does not consist of car type e.g. sedan, SUV, coupe etc
